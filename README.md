# Entertainer_analysis
Overview :
I have done this project as part of the Unified Mentor Private Limited Internship.

Problem Statement :
Normal life can be stressful, and people need to relax. Being entertained by others is a wonderful way to take some time out of life. It can reduce stress and make life's issues easier to face. The media and entertainment industry consists of film, television, radio and print. These segments include movies, TV shows, radio shows, news, music, newspapers, magazines, and books. The entertainment industry is a group of sub-industries devoted to entertainment. The entertainment industry is used to describe the mass media companies that control the distribution and manufacture of mass media entertainment.

Insights :

While most artists experience their breakthrough between the ages of 25 and 35, there are notable exceptions like Louis Armstrong at 48 and Morgan Freeman at 55, who achieved their breakthroughs later in life.

On average, female artists have a career span of 33.80 years, while male artists have a slightly longer average career span of 35.12 years.

Between 1960 and 1985, the number of awards received by artists peaked, marking a period of exceptional recognition and achievement in the industry.

Within 10 years of their breakthrough, half of the artists received their first major awards.
